# Shadowing Record – Cardiothoracic Critical Care

**Date**: September 2025 
**Total Hours**: 1.0 (includes discussion and patient observation)  
**Clinician**: Attending Physician, MD  
**Location**: Academic Medical Center, Critical Care Unit  
**Specialty**: Cardiothoracic Critical Care  
**Focus**: Management of patients with cardiac and thoracic complications  

## Overview
In September I shadowed an attending physician in the critical care unit of an academic medical center, focusing on cardiothoracic critical care. The session included a discussion on palliative care, chart review of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for a patient with a cardiac condition managed with extracorporeal support, and observation of a live transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) for a postoperative patient with complex medical needs. These experiences provided valuable insight into diagnostic imaging, critical care interventions, and patient-centered care strategies in cardiothoracic settings.

## Educational Discussion
- **Palliative Care**: Engaged in a detailed discussion with the attending physician about palliative care principles, focusing on their application in managing patients with life-limiting cardiac and thoracic conditions. Shared personal motivations for interest in palliative care, which the physician commended as a meaningful focus. Explored strategies for integrating palliative care to enhance patient and family outcomes in critical care settings.
- **Medical School and Mentorship**: Reviewed my medical school application timeline and career aspirations in medicine. The physician recommended shadowing another cardiothoracic critical care specialist, available on weekends, to further expand my exposure.

## Clinical Observations
### Patient 1: Cardiac Condition with Extracorporeal Support (Chart Review)
- **Case Overview**: Reviewed the electronic medical record (EMR) of a patient with a cardiac condition, likely heart valve dysfunction, managed with venoarterial extracorporeal support to maintain circulation. The physician explained the support system, which facilitates oxygenation and circulation, bypassing compromised cardiac function in cardiogenic shock.
- **Chart and Imaging Review**: Analyzed postoperative TEE imaging in the EMR, focusing on cardiac structure assessment, such as valve pathology (specific valve, e.g., aortic or mitral, to be confirmed). The physician highlighted management strategies, including hemodynamic monitoring and anticoagulation protocols.
- **Key Learning**: Gained understanding of extracorporeal support indications, mechanics, and monitoring in cardiothoracic critical care, as well as the role of TEE in assessing valve dysfunction post-intervention.

### Patient 2: Cardiac Condition with Live TTE (Postoperative, Complex Medical Needs)
- **Case Overview**: Observed a live transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) performed by the attending physician and another clinician, with nursing support, on a postoperative patient with complex medical needs, likely following cardiothoracic surgery. The TTE visualized cardiac structures (e.g., left anterior descending or right coronary artery) and heart valves, to assess cardiopulmonary function.
- **Procedure Details**: Noted the physician’s expertise in capturing high-quality TTE images despite challenges posed by the patient’s condition, which required optimized positioning and ultrasound settings. Specific findings (e.g., ejection fraction, valve function) to be confirmed from chart.
- **Key Learning**: Learned the technical and clinical aspects of TTE in cardiothoracic critical care, particularly for complex postoperative patients, and the collaborative roles of physicians and nurses in non-invasive cardiac diagnostics.

## Documentation Notes
- **Omissions**: Specific diagnoses (e.g., valve type, coronary artery details), TTE metrics (e.g., ejection fraction, regurgitation severity), and patient comorbidities were not recorded. These should be verified from the primary medical record.
- **Additional Details**: Names of the second clinician and nurse involved in the TTE, as well as the recommended specialist for shadowing, to be confirmed from the attending physician or chart.

## Reflection
This shadowing experience deepened my understanding of cardiothoracic critical care, particularly through exposure to extracorporeal support and TTE in managing complex cardiac and thoracic conditions. The palliative care discussion reinforced the importance of patient-centered approaches, while observing live TTE highlighted the precision and teamwork required in non-invasive diagnostics, especially in challenging patient populations. The physician’s mentorship and shadowing recommendations have further deepened my commitment to becoming a physician.
