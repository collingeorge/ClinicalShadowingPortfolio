# Shadowing Record – Anesthesiology

**Date**: September 2025 
**Total Hours**: 1.5 (includes setup, induction, maintenance, emergence)  
**Clinician**: Attending Anesthesiologist, MD; Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA)  
**Location**: Academic Medical Center, Operating Room  
**Specialty**: Anesthesiology  
**Focus**: Management of anesthesia during orthopedic procedures  

## Overview
In September, I shadowed an attending anesthesiologist and a CRNA during an orthopedic procedure at an academic medical center. The session involved observing the full anesthesia process—setup, induction, maintenance, and emergence—for a patient undergoing a procedure such as a fracture reduction or joint replacement. This experience provided insights into anesthesia protocols, patient safety, and interdisciplinary teamwork in the operating room.

## Educational Discussion
- **Anesthesia Protocols**: Discussed the anesthesia workflow, including induction techniques, intraoperative monitoring, and patient safety strategies with the anesthesiologist. Learned about balancing sedation with hemodynamic stability and the rationale for avoiding certain premedications in patients with specific comorbidities.
- **Medical School and Mentorship**: Reviewed my premed journey and medical school application timeline. The anesthesiologist recommended additional shadowing in the operating room to explore anesthesiology’s role in surgical care.

## Clinical Observations
### Patient 1: Orthopedic Procedure (Induction and Airway Management)
- **Case Overview**: Observed the induction process for a patient undergoing an orthopedic procedure (specific condition to be confirmed from chart). The anesthesiologist administered intravenous agents, including a local anesthetic to reduce injection discomfort, an opioid analgesic, and a non-depolarizing paralytic.
- **Procedure Details**: Noted the setup of standard monitoring (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry, blood pressure) and additional tools like neuromuscular monitoring. Airway management involved direct laryngoscopy with endotracheal tube placement, performed without complications. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed.
- **Key Learning**: Gained understanding of induction sequencing, airway management, and the importance of monitoring to ensure patient safety during anesthesia.

### Orthopedic Procedure (Maintenance and Emergence)
- **Case Overview**: Observed intraoperative maintenance and emergence for a patient post-induction during the same orthopedic procedure. The team used a volatile anesthetic and titrated intravenous sedatives to maintain anesthesia depth.
- **Procedure Details**: Noted adjustments to anesthesia based on monitoring feedback (e.g., depth of anesthesia, vital signs). Emergence involved reversal of paralysis and discontinuation of anesthetics, with the patient achieving spontaneous ventilation and following commands before extubation.
- **Key Learning**: Learned about real-time anesthesia adjustments, reversal agents, and the collaborative roles of the anesthesiologist, CRNA, and surgical team in ensuring a smooth emergence.

## Documentation Notes
- **Omissions**: Specific diagnoses, medications, doses, and monitoring metrics (e.g., anesthesia depth, ventilator settings) were not recorded to maintain privacy. These should be verified from the primary medical record.
- **Additional Details**: Names of clinicians and specific procedure details (e.g., fracture type) to be confirmed from chart.
- **ASA Classification**: Likely ASA III due to mild systemic disease and comorbidities; confirm from chart.

## Reflection
This shadowing experience deepened my understanding of anesthesiology’s critical role in surgical care, particularly in managing induction, airway, and emergence for orthopedic procedures. Observing the precision of anesthesia delivery and the teamwork between the anesthesiologist and CRNA highlighted the importance of patient safety and interdisciplinary collaboration. This experience has strengthened my interest in anesthesiology as a potential specialty and reinforced my commitment to becoming a physician.
