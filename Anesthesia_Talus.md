# Shadowing Record – Anesthesiology

**Date**: September 2025
**Total Hours**: 0.7 (includes setup and induction)  
**Clinician**: Attending Anesthesiologist, MD; Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA)  
**Location**: Academic Medical Center, Operating Room  
**Specialty**: Anesthesiology  
**Focus**: Induction for orthopedic procedures  

## Overview
In September, I shadowed an attending anesthesiologist and a CRNA during the induction phase of an orthopedic procedure, such as a fracture repair or bone grafting, at an academic medical center. The session focused on pre-anesthesia setup, induction, and airway management, providing insights into anesthesia protocols and patient safety. I exited the operating room after airway confirmation, deepening my understanding of anesthesiology’s role in surgical care.

## Educational Discussion
- **Anesthesia Protocols**: Discussed induction techniques, including the use of sedatives, analgesics, and paralytics, with the anesthesiologist. Learned about the rationale for premedication choices based on patient history and the importance of monitoring during induction.
- **Medical School and Mentorship**: Reviewed my premed journey and medical school application goals. The anesthesiologist encouraged further shadowing to explore anesthesiology’s integration with surgical teams.

## Clinical Observations
### Patient 1: Orthopedic Procedure (Induction and Airway Management)
- **Case Overview**: Observed the induction process for a patient undergoing an orthopedic procedure (specific condition to be confirmed from chart). The anesthesiologist and CRNA administered intravenous agents, including a sedative for anxiolysis, a local anesthetic to reduce injection discomfort, an opioid analgesic, and a non-depolarizing paralytic.
- **Procedure Details**: Noted the setup of standard monitoring (e.g., ECG, pulse oximetry, blood pressure) and additional tools like neuromuscular monitoring. Airway management involved direct laryngoscopy with endotracheal tube placement, performed without complications. Bilateral breath sounds confirmed. I exited post-airway confirmation.
- **Key Learning**: Gained understanding of induction sequencing, airway management techniques, and the importance of monitoring to ensure patient safety during anesthesia initiation.

## Documentation Notes
- **Omissions**: Specific diagnoses, medications, doses, and monitoring metrics (e.g., anesthesia depth, ventilator settings) were not recorded to maintain privacy. Maintenance, emergence, and postoperative details were not observed and should be verified from the primary medical record.
- **Additional Details**: Names of clinicians and specific procedure details (e.g., fracture type) to be confirmed from chart.
- **ASA Classification**: Likely ASA II due to mild systemic disease; confirm from chart.

## Reflection
This shadowing experience highlighted the precision and teamwork required in anesthesiology, particularly during the induction phase of an orthopedic procedure. Observing the careful administration of anesthetics and airway management underscored the critical role of patient safety and collaboration between the anesthesiologist and CRNA. This brief but impactful exposure has strengthened my interest and commitment to anesthesiology as a potential specialty.
